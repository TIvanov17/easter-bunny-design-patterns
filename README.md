# The Great Easter Bunny

<p><i>
 &nbsp The Great Easter Bunny had special access to a Magic Bag that could create three types of eggs: 
  
  * quail    
  * hen      
  * dinosaur  
  
  When an egg is created, he takes it and colors it or sticker it randomly.
  He placed the Decorated Eggs in a basket. <br> There were 3 little chicks who watched the basket and
  when the eggs in it became more than 5, <br> they announced in one voice: <b>"The Eggs are ready !" </b>.
